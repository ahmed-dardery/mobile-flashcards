# Mobile Flashcards

This is my work on the Mobile Flashcards Project as a part of the Udacity React Nanodegree Course.

## Development

Depending on your development environment, you will need to set up a physical device with expo installed, or a simulator. Once you have your development environment set up:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `expo start`

## Building

To build this project for deployment, configure `app.json` accordingly then run `exp build:ios` or `exp build:android`
